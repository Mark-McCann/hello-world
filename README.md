# hello-world
5th of July Starting with github
I just registered with github because I'm doing the coursera course on R programming and they told us to set up a github account.
I'm currently off on sick leave after shoulder surgery and I'm using voice recognition software to type. It's struggling a little bit with my Irish accent!
